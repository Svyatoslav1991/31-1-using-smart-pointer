# 31-1-using-smart-pointer

What should be done
Implement a Dog class that uses the standard shared_ptr smart pointer for the Toy class.
Implement the getToy method for the Dog class, which allows the dog to pick up a toy.
If the dog already has this toy, you need to print the phrase: I already have this toy to the console.
If another dog currently has the toy, you need to output to the console: Another dog is playing with this toy.
If the toy is free, the dog picks it up.
Implement a dropToy method for the Dog class, which allows a dog to drop a toy on the floor, after which another dog can pick it up.
If the dog does not have a toy at this moment, you need to output to the console: Nothing to drop.
